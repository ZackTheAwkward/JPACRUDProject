# JPACRUDProject

## Description
The goal for this project was to create a SQL database, create a JPA application that utilized that database, and perform basic CRUD operations with the JPA application. For this project, I created a database with a table to list local Breweries in the Denver area. The database table mapped out fields for a primary key, the name of the brewery, and other fields that helped map out the location of the brewery. By using SpringBoot, I was created a dynamic web application that allowed a user to implement basic CRUD operations. The user was directed to a home page that gave them 4 options to chose from. These options included create, update, delete, or search for a brewery. The home page also showed a full list of all the breweries in the database, with a hyperlink to go to the breweries details. If the user created, updated, or deleted a brewery, it would reflect these changes on the list.

## Lessons Learned
This project helped solidify my understanding of how to create a single table database using MySQL workbench. I am eager to learn how to create multiple tables with parent/child relationships next. This project also helped me better understand java servlet pages and how to implement them with mapping requests and redirect attributes.
