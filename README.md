# JPACRUDProject

## Description
The goal for this project was to create a SQL database, create a JPA application that utilized that database, and perform basic CRUD operations with the JPA application. For this project, I created a database with a table to list local Breweries in the Denver area. The database table mapped out fields for a primary key, the name of the brewery, and other fields that helped map out the location of the brewery. By using SpringBoot, I was created a dynamic web application that allowed a user to implement basic CRUD operations. The user was directed to a home page that gave them 4 options to chose from. These options included create, update, delete, or search for a brewery. The home page also showed a full list of all the breweries in the database, with a hyperlink to go to the breweries details. If the user created, updated, or deleted a brewery, it would reflect these changes on the list.

## Lessons Learned
This project helped solidify my understanding of how to create a single table database using MySQL workbench. I am eager to learn how to create multiple tables with parent/child relationships next. This project also helped me better understand java servlet pages and how to implement them with mapping requests and redirect attributes.

After completing the main object for this project, I really focused on learning a lot more about how to use bootstrap to implement a better user interface.
A lot of my learning came from looking at example code and different methods for using bootstrap and CSS styling sheets. I'm most proud of my Google Web API implementation, by taking in a latitude and longitude data type, I was able to plug in those variables into the javascript code so each brewery showed it's correct location on the map.
